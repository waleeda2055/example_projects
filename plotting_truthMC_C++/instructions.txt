this assumes the two files are in the folder "MyTest"
See where the files are loaded (_file0, _file1) and make sure it points to the correct location

the output plots are put in the folder "plotDir = OutputPlots/LHOverlays"

either create that directory or change it to somethign that exists. I suggest that it's a directory, though, because there are lots of output files!

Then, do:

root -l -b AtlasStyle.C AtlasLabels.C
...
root will load...
warnings about AtlasLabels are fine

For x,y axes labels to appear
SetAtlasStyle()

then do:
.x makeLHProfiles.cxx

and it should spit out a bazillion plots, into the directory you created. running wiht -b means that you dont' show the canvas as you're running, which is useful if you're tunneling from lxplus.

then, just scp the directory locally and enjoy the plots!
